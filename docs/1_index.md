# What is Freepower?

At Freepower, our mission is simple: help Kiwis spend less on electricity. We’ve built two powerful tools to make that happen:

- [https://freepower.nz/](https://freepower.nz/) – you can upload your power bill on our website, and we’ll instantly show whether you’re on the best deal available, comparing real plans from across the New Zealand market.
- [AI Freepower Assisstant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-684963c81e48819185b4d573483246b8-free-power-assistant) – Ask questions in plain English like “How can I save on my power bill?” and get helpful, accurate advice based on live pricing data from our ChatGPT powered plugin.

We believe understanding and saving on electricity should be easy for everyone.
