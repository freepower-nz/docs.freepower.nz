# API Authentication & Environments

We provide two environments for developers working with the Freepower API:

- [`https://try.freepower.nz/api`](https://try.freepower.nz/api) – **Playground / Testing**
- [`https://api.freepower.nz/api`](https://api.freepower.nz/api) – **Production**

---

## 🧪 Testing Environment (`try.freepower.nz`)

The Testing environment behaves **exactly the same** as our production API in terms of endpoints and authentication. However, the **underlying data** may be **mocked or limited**, especially:

- Address search results may be stubbed or incomplete.
- Pricing or ICP data may be pre-cached or anonymised.
- We do this to prevent abuse and ensure the playground remains lightweight and open.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The API token used in the try environment is **periodically regenerated**.  
> This makes it **unsuitable for real-time or automated integrations** — use it only for manual testing or prototyping.

## 🔐 Getting a Production Token

When you're ready to go live and access full production data, email us at 📧 [`developers@freepower.nz`](mailto:developers@freepower.nz)

Please let us know:

- What you're building
- The expected usage (how many requests, types of endpoints, etc.)

We'll issue you a **private API token**.

## 💸 Pricing & Access

- The Freepower API is **free for personal use and hobby projects**.
- We have a **very friendly pricing policy** for commercial use.
- We're also proud to support any project aligned with the **#openenergy** movement or efforts to help **New Zealand energy customers**.

Just reach out — we’re keen to help.
